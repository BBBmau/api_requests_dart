API Request Example for Dart / Flutter
---
This repo has a simple dart program that converts a long URL to a shorter version of it with the help of the `http` package and the LSTU API.

It also uses a `json` package to convert the web form into a json block for easier access. This can be used as a reference for any Dart applications as well as Flutter applications that will use REST APIs.

A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.
